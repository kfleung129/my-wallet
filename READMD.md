## Features

- **Transaction Recording:** Users can add new transactions by specifying the transaction type (expense or income), amount, category, and additional notes.
- **Categorization and Filtering:** Transactions can be categorized into different categories (e.g., groceries, transportation, salary) for better organization. Users can also filter their transactions based on date, category, or transaction type.
- **Expense Analysis:** The app provides visual representations (graphs and charts) of the user's expenses, allowing them to gain insights into their spending habits and identify areas where they can save money.
